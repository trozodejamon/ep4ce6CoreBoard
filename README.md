These are a collection of notes and resources, inasmuch for myself as for anyone else who might need it. They are a combination of what the seller has sent to me (i.e., schematics) and information I have gleamed from probing the board myself while referring to the schematics. If you find any errors, please let me know, or fork and make a pull request. NO WARRANTY IS PROVIDED, either expressed or implied. As always, the best is to double check yourself before you do something irreversible.
